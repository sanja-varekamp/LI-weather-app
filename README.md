# weather-app

This weather app was coded during a code along, as a part of a 19 hour JavaScript course on Udemy by Shaun Peiling (The Net Ninja). 

By typing the name of a city in the text box followed by pressing enter, the current temperature is shown on the very bottom. Above it is a description with an icon of the weather, and the big image that takes most of the window, is displaying is it night or a day in the selected city. The app works with APIs from AccuWeather.
